      Hello, world!
    </p>
    <p>
      Welcome to my first web page!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some things I'm going to learn about coding:
    </p>
<!--Adding an unordered list with its items-->
    <ol>
      <li>
        HTML
      </li>
        <p>
          HTML is the most fundamental pillar of web development.<br>
          HTML has some <a href="https://blog.greenroots.info/10-trivial-yet-powerful-html-facts-you-must-know" alt="Powerful HTML facts" title="html facts" target="_blank">trivial facts</a> that could be very powerful when we know to use them.
        </p>
      <li>
        css
      </li>
      <li>
        JavaScript
      </li>
      <li>
        And a lot more!
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
      HTML
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>HyperText</strong> is just a fancy word for text that links to something else.<br>
      <strong>Markup Language</strong> is what marks up the text with the instructions written inside of these angle brackets <>, known as tags.<br>
      The actual language of HTML is the instructions that we wrap around the text to format it and as we'll see, instructions for many other things like images, links, videos and more.

      While learning the basics of web development at Moringa I happened to meet very awesome friends, just to name but a few:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Derrick Mokonge
        </li>
        <li>
          James Muthike
        </li>
        <li>
          Charity Waweru
        </li>
        <li>
          Emmanuel Ngomo
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      My meal number one for lunch at Moringa space was <em>chapatti</em> and <em>mandondo</em>.
