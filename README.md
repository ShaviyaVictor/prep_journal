# PREP PROGRESS JOURNAL
### Description
Do you ever feel stuck or stagnant?   
You’re busy, but are you really seeing results from your efforts?   
We spin our wheels all week but don't always have much to show for it.   
It’s frustrating, and frankly, it’s exhausting.   
The bad news is it's also typical. In our mind, we have these great visions of what we want to accomplish and where we want to go. But day to day, we get bogged down with distractions, other people's agendas, and busywork. And then we wonder why we're not getting anywhere!   
It's like treading water and expecting to get to the other side of the pool.

This Prep Progress Journal is here to offer a simple but purposeful way to project the outcomes from some of my most important work—and ***track my results***—so that my effort is never wasted.
### How The Progress Journal Works
There are countless habits that aid productivity but just a **handful of keystone habits** tend to make the biggest impact on my personal productivity.   
Those are the habits I’ve baked into this journal, and the ones I’m confident will have you feeling better and more productive about your work right away.

Those keystone habits are:  
* Setting short-term “sprint” goals, and breaking those down into the smallest actionable steps.   
* Identifying your top 1-3 priorities each day and measuring your progress on those.   
* Practicing gratitude.   
* Establishing and tracking too-small-to-fail “micro habits”.   
* Identifying and tracking your Key Performance Indicators.
It’s not a huge time commitment or massive lifestyle shift. In fact, updating this journal should take less than 5 minutes a day.
### Why Progress?
I’m obsessed with progress.

To me, *progress means forward motion*, or actively taking the steps to **improve each day**. It’s one thing we can control.   
And progress is universal; ___everyone___ can make progress toward their goals in some meaningful way, however small the steps may seem.

It turns out I’m not alone either. *We’re wired to seek progress*; psychologists have found it to be a key factor in our overall happiness.   
> Tony Robbins calls it the “**1-word secret to happiness**,” telling CNBC, "I always tell people if you want to know the secret to happiness, I can give it to you in one word: progress."
