# PREP PROGRESS JOURNAL
### Description
Do you ever feel stuck or stagnant?   
You’re busy, but are you really seeing results from your efforts?   
We spin our wheels all week but don't always have much to show for it.   
It’s frustrating, and frankly, it’s exhausting.   
The bad news is it's also typical. In our mind, we have these great visions of what we want to accomplish and where we want to go. But day to day, we get bogged down with distractions, other people's agendas, and busywork. And then we wonder why we're not getting anywhere!   
It's like treading water and expecting to get to the other side of the pool.

This Prep Progress Journal is here to offer a simple but purposeful way to project the outcomes from some of my most important work—and ***track my results***—so that my effort is never wasted.
